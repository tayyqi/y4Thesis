                        <p class="fs-5half">In Singapore, it is inevitable to be exposed to digital media, with Singaporeans spending an average of 8 hours and 7 minutes online daily, 
                            significantly greater than the global average of 6 hours and 4 minutes (Neo, 2021). In recent years, bedtime procrastination has been in the spotlight as it 
                            leads to sleep deprivation which reduces overall wellbeing and productivity (Hafner et al., 2017). This dissertation studies the effects of digital media on 
                            bedtime procrastination in young adults and proposes design concepts that could intervene and reduce this behaviour.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <!-- <p class="lead">The background images used in this template are sourced from Unsplash and are open source and free to use.</p> -->
                        <p class="fs-5half"> Bedtime procrastination is the action of going to bed later than intended, without external reasons to do so while being fully aware 
                            of its negative consequences (Kroese et al., 2014). This behaviour is closely associated with brain-stimulating activities such as watching TV or using 
                            smartphones before sleep. With the onset of the pandemic, the shift to remote work has blurred the boundaries between work and rest, increasing the 
                            propensity for late bedtimes (Schlundt, 2021). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5half">
                            In Singapore, digital media usage plays the biggest role in this behaviour (Chee & Massar, 2021). In the 2021 global sleep study by Philips, 69% of 
                            Singapore’s respondents who use their phones before falling asleep admit that it leads them to fall asleep later than they would like to, with a majority 
                            rolling through social media or watching videos in the time before sleep. This is in line with the Singapore-based study conducted by Yong Loo Lin School of
                             Medicine, reporting that 65% of respondents listed engagement with some type of electronic media to be one of the activities that keep them from going to 
                             bed (Chee & Massar, 2021).
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5half">
                            Bedtime procrastination leads to sleep deprivation, resulting in a loss in productivity (Furuichi et al., 2020), dip in mental health, and overall wellbeing
                             (Hafner et al., 2017). This is detrimental in Singapore’s productivity-driven society, therefore it is essential to take steps to reduce any unnecessary 
                             pushing back of bedtimes. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5half">
                            Studies have shown that bedtime procrastination may relate to general procrastination (Kroese et al., 2014). In addition, general procrastination is the 
                            most common in early adulthood (McCown & Roberts, 1994). In this dissertation, I will be investigating the effects of digital media consumption on bedtime
                             procrastination of young adults in their 20s in Singapore, aiming to identify design opportunities to intervene in their bedtime procrastination behaviours.

                        <h3>Digital Media and Bedtime Procrastination</h3>
                        <p class="fs-5half">The pandemic has brought about changes in lifestyle patterns of university students, increasing bedtime procrastination 
                            through digital media use (Cellini et al., 2020). Singapore has a high mobile penetration rate of 157.7% as of June 2021 (Infocomm Media 
                            Development Authority, 2021). The increasingly portable and accessible technologies have made it inevitable to be exposed to attention-grabbing 
                            content available on the internet from a young age (Tang, 2019). This may be why young adults, who are mostly Generation Z, are heavily reliant 
                            on technology and more prone to phone addiction. The portability of a phone also makes it much more convenient to be propped up next to the pillow
                             to scroll through while lying in bed.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5half">
                            Tristan Harris, a founder of Time Well Spent and ex-design ethicist at Google, highlighted 3 features that make phones addictive (Haubursin, 2018):
                        </p>

                                   <i>Unpredictable content of notifications</i>
                                   <br>These exist as push notifications that hide and obscure information, enticing the user to click on it to read the full contents.
                                </li>
                                <li><i>Attention-grabbing colours</i>
                                    <br>Application icons use bright warm colours such as red and orange to draw attention.

                                <li><i>Infinite scrolling and video autoplay</i>
                                    <br>By introducing a never-ending flow of content, users are less likely to break away from their phones as there is no visual indication of an endpoint.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        
                        <p class="fs-5half">
                            Of all applications, the stimulating and rewarding nature of social media seems to be the most addictive (Levenson, 2016). As social media involves 
                            interactive screen time, which is more engaging as compared to passive activities like watching television (Hale & Guan, 2015), it is harder to fall 
                            asleep.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5half"><i>Bedtime Procrastination</i>
                            <br>Bedtime procrastination occurs at the end of the day, where there may be fewer resources available for self-regulation due to fatigue 
                            (Kamphorst et al., 2018). As compared to daytime phone usage, it may be harder for users to disconnect from the addictive content constantly being 
                            fed to them as the desire to watch one more episode is far greater than the desire to be awake for an important meeting the next day. Moreover, users
                             may lose track of time due to the lack of visual indication of the time passed while being absorbed to their screens, making it harder to break away 
                             from their screens. As users fall into the bottomless vortex of digital media, their sleep time is delayed which leads to sleep deprivation.

                        <p class="fs-5half">Wind-Down time refers to the window before sleep when your body shifts from an “on” to “off” state, usually occurring one to two 
                            hours before sleep (Rise Science, n.d.). Sleep experts recommend engaging in passive tasks to help the body and mind slow down to a relaxed state, 
                            making it easier to fall asleep and ensuring good sleep quality. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5half">
                            In a self-conducted survey, with 37 respondents aged 18-25 years old, 86.5% reported using their phones right before sleep. Additionally, more than 
                            half of respondents spent 30 minutes or less preparing for sleep, with 21.6% not preparing for sleep at all (Figure 2). 
                        </p>

                            When asked about the reasons for phone usage before bed, respondents found a need to unwind using their phones, feeling the need to connect through 
                            social media and relax through YouTube videos. We can derive that there is a strong dependency on digital media to unwind at the end of the day 
                            despite research showing the adverse effects of phone usage before sleep.

                        <p class="fs-5half">As discussed above, bedtime procrastination in young adults largely occurs on mobile phones, due to the addictive nature of digital 
                            media. Thus, I will be focusing on the phone interface and wind-down time as my design space. In the following section, I will describe early design 
                            explorations that revolve around this design space.

                        <p class="fs-5half">The first exploration focuses on customised sleep reminders based on current activities on the phone and future schedules. 
                            Previous designs for sleep reminders relied on a pre-set sleep time but did not account for pre-sleep phone usage or daily schedules (e.g. 
                            Samsung Bedtime, Oura).

                            the participants’ “ideal self”, which sets up a role model for the participant. Additionally, there was slight customisation to participant’s pre-sleep 
                            habits in the second nudge to prepare for sleep.

                        <p class="fs-5half">Out of 4 participants, 3 felt that the messages which addressed participants directly were more effective at evoking guilt 
                            at not following their sleep times, while those written in third person felt quite disconnected. Generally, the messages were useful in increasing awareness 
                            of one’s sleep schedule and their need for sleep. However, these messages were not particularly effective in pushing participants to stop using their phones 
                            and sleep.

                        <p class="fs-5half">User interviews with 4 other university students  found that sleep times were largely dependent on the time they had to wake up 
                            for the next day. Lessons in university did not start at the same time every day (Figure 3), which resulted in a drastically varying sleep schedule throughout 
                            the week, and thus less motivation to follow the reminders which were sent at fixed times every day.

                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5half ">To motivate users to follow the sleep reminders, the reminders could be customised according to specific important events from the user’s 
                            calendar. This is because scheduled calendar events are likely to be important or special, such as appointments, all-day events, and to-do items (Tungare 
                            et al., 2008). This helps to set a short-term goal, framing it such that sticking to their sleep schedule would help achieve this goal.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5half ">3 distinct examples of such notifications were made and shown to 6 university students for user feedback.

                            notifications relating to assignments were slightly effective. The notification relating to skincare received surprisingly positive reactions, with a respondent stating 
                            that based on experience, sleeping early does improve the appearance of the skin, and would sleep on time.

                        <h5>Design exploration 2: Disruptive User Interface</h5>
                        <p class="fs-5half ">People tend to follow visual cues rather than internal reminders (Haubursin, 2018). As bedtime procrastination mostly happens on the phone, 
                            these cues should be present on the phone interface to effectively break the flow of media browsing. Additionally, visual cues serve as a step up from passive 
                            reminders by directly inhibiting phone usage, which would be useful for those who are less sensitive to reminders.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5half ">I have explored various design possibilities of disruptive UI within a spectrum of subtle to obvious. In the first phase of user testing, 
                            6 university students were presented with a mobile device with an interactive interface showing the effects of grayscale, scroll lag and screen blur. 
                            In the second phase, 6 university students were sent videos of social media interfaces mimicking pre-sleep browsing behaviour with a gradually decreasing screen size.

                                that their attention was drawn more to the moving bar than the content, which gave them a sense of urgency of the time passing, making it 
                                the most effective in depicting the approaching sleep time. On the other hand, the distractive nature of the animation led some users to be 
                                fascinated and not feel like sleeping.

                            of annoyance are effective in deterring users from using their phones. On the other hand, hiding content may lead to curiosity and being more awake. 
                            A balance must be found to evoke a sense of urgency without evoking negative emotions or fascination with the applied animations.

                        <p class="fs-5half ">Having analysed the effect of digital media on bedtime procrastination, I will be using customised sleep notifications and obvious 
                            disruptive interfaces as key nudges in developing an appropriate intervention to reduce bedtime procrastination in young adults that unnecessarily 
                            push back their sleep times. Further explorations are needed to ensure that the disruptive UI is obvious without invoking negative emotions.
